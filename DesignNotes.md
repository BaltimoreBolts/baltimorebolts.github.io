### The id: of each div that can be useable will be mentioned
Ideas as of (7/1/20) 

- Undeviating (https://templated.co/undeviating)
    - div,id: header wrapper 
        - This header has a very nice layout, the rounded corners are nice

- Hielo (https://templated.co/hielo)
    - div,id: header
        - Epic landing page, but we dont have images high rez enough to look good there, maybe a montage video instead or a smaller frame, similar to the one in Polychromasia
    - div,id: two 
        - Great place to put a sigle line qoute the team likes to go by or maybe start a highlight section for a highlight section for the robots.  

- EarthyBlue (https://templated.co/earthyblue)
    - div,id: header-wrapper/ header/logo/menu
        - Simple And leaves a lot of open space for that modern look
        - Its centered and would look good with a wide spread Baltimore Bolts logo on top

- Crosswalk (https://templated.co/crosswalk)
    - div,id: featured
        - Can be used as a learn more or super apparent sign up page
    
- Untamed (https://templated.co/untamed)
    - div,id: wrapper/ featured-wrapper  
        - Dont know of a reason to have I cons but incase we should we can use this template

- Polychromasia (https://templated.co/polychromasia)
    - There is no one thing that is good about this template. The orginaization of it all is clean and crisp. however I think the hero image should be spread all the way across 

- OpenSpace (https://templated.co/openspace)
    - div,id: wrapper/page
        - Really nice event highlighter. Can be used for broadcasting Open Houses, or comp days
    - div,id: wrapper/staff
        - The tall pictures in this div are not going to work due to rez but smaller or picters in a collage will look cool
