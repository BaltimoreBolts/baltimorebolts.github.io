# Design Notes

### These are ideas and source insprations for the website (cause logging and note taking is better than not)
### Ideas as of (7/1/20) they were in a different notepad before

### The id: of each div that can be useable will be mentioned

- Undeviating (https://templated.co/undeviating)
    - Gallery instead of static photo

- Hielo (https://templated.co/hielo)
    - div,id: header
        - Epic landing page, but we dont have images high rez enough to look good there, maybe a montage video instead or a smaller frame, similar to the one in Polychromasia
    - div,id: two 
        - Great place to put a sigle line qoute the team likes to go by or maybe start a highlight section for a highlight section for the robots.  

- EarthyBlue (https://templated.co/earthyblue)
    - div,id: header-wrapper/ header/logo/menu
        - Simple And leaves a lot of open space for that modern look
        - Its centered and would look good with a wide spread Baltimore Bolts logo on top

- Crosswalk (https://templated.co/crosswalk)
    - div,id: featured
        - Can be used as a learn more or super apparent sign up page
    
- Untamed (https://templated.co/untamed)
    - Simple layout, maybe too much space for words

- Polychromasia (https://templated.co/polychromasia)
    - Modern Layout

- OpenSpace (https://templated.co/openspace)
    - div,id: wrapper/page
        - Really nice event highlighter. Can be used for broadcasting Open Houses, or comp days
